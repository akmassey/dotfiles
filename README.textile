h1. Aaron Massey's dotfiles

This repository contains the various configuration files that I use on Mac OS X, linux, and other unix-like operating systems.  I've also included a couple of my favorite scripts.  Essentially, this is the first thing I install on a new system when I know I'm going to spend some time there.  This repository was inspired by Ryan Bates, whose "dotfiles are hosted here.":http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/tree/master
